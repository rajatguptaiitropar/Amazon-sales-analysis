Amazon Sales Analysis 📈


📝 Project Description


This project provides a comprehensive analysis of an Amazon sales dataset using Python. The primary goal is to clean and process raw sales data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends, and extract actionable insights. The analysis focuses on key business questions related to sales performance, geographical distribution, product category success, and order fulfillment, demonstrating a full data analysis workflow from raw data to business intelligence.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language for the analysis.

Pandas: For high-performance data manipulation, cleaning, and aggregation.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating insightful and visually appealing static plots.

SQL (via pandasql): To demonstrate database querying skills on the DataFrame.

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab: As the development environment for interactive analysis.

✨ Key Features & Analysis
Data Cleaning: Rigorous preprocessing of the dataset to handle missing values, correct data types, and standardize column names for consistency.

Sales Trend Analysis: A time-series analysis to visualize sales performance over the given period, identifying peak months and sales cycles.

Geographical Insights: Identification of the top 10 highest-revenue generating states to inform regional marketing and logistics strategies.

Product Category Performance: Analysis of the most popular and profitable product categories by both sales volume and order count.

Order Fulfillment Analysis: A breakdown of order statuses (e.g., Shipped, Cancelled, Delivered) to evaluate the efficiency of the fulfillment pipeline.

SQL-Based Querying: In-notebook SQL queries to extract specific metrics like average order value and sales performance by shipping service level.


💡 Key Insights Discovered
The analysis successfully pinpointed Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh as the top 3 states by sales, highlighting them as key markets for targeted growth.

T-shirts, Kurtas, and Sets were identified as the leading product categories, suggesting they are major drivers of revenue and should be prioritized in inventory and marketing.

A significant portion of orders are successfully shipped, but the analysis of cancelled orders provides an opportunity to investigate and reduce pre-fulfillment cancellations.

The average order value provides a baseline for customer spending, which can be used to measure the effectiveness of upselling and cross-selling campaigns.
